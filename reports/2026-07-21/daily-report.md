## ⚠️ ALERTS SUMMARY

| # | Source | Alert |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | Fountain production (Performance + rick@ email) | Error volume REACTIVATED/worsened, not tapering — ArgumentError 95x + NoMethodError 90x today vs 9x+9x on 07-19, same signature as 07-18's incident. Plus 3 new distinct errors (#288 Stripe::InvalidRequestError, #289 ActionView::Template::Error, #290 Net::ReadTimeout) and #284 hit 100 occurrences. `[Overdue] Bug: duplicate error message on capture payment` still open. |
| 2 | MPFC (Performance) | 🔒 Security: 2 of 5 slowest transactions are time-based blind SQL-injection probes (`WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:15'`) against `/search/` — response time matches injected delay, meaning the payload reached a query-executing code path. |
| 3 | MPFC (Performance) | Apdex still poor at 0.50, unchanged for multiple days — WP_Error::get_method() (45x) + JSON_API_User_controller::error() (34x) persist unresolved. |
| 4 | Sheets/Workstream (all devs) | Workstream SSO login failed twice (90s + 150s timeouts, stuck at "Clicked Sign in with SSO") — needs interactive 2FA unavailable in this session. Google Sheets fallback confirmed genuinely empty for 07-20 across all 13 sheets (verified raw cells directly, not just script output) — daily hour totals for LongVV/PhucVT/TuanNT/KhanhHH/LeNH cannot be verified this run. Blocks Maddy/John Yi/Bailey/Rebecca/Aysar/Elliott/Blair Brown Trello items + Fountain Parts 2-3 + Maddy JIRA cross-check. |
| 5 | Arthur/Meta-Stamp | Slack "Solid Code" + Workstream (Crystal lang) + GitHub all unavailable — 3rd consecutive run (07-15, 07-17, 07-21). Diagnosed root causes: Slack cookie-extraction script has no DBUS/keyring access in this sandbox (0 cookies extracted); Workstream same SSO issue as #4; GitHub `davidztv` account not configured anywhere in this environment. Matrix-only coverage this run, and only for the last 24h (gap 07-15→07-20 not caught up). |
| 6 | Arthur/Meta-Stamp | NEW: P2-7 (Metadata Intake Tiers) blocked — Phúc messaged Arthur for Chris confirmation, no reply yet. Investor demo funding result (from 07-14) still unknown after 1+ week. |
| 7 | OhCleo Slack | `invalid_auth`. Restored deleted `get-slack-all-cookies.py` from git history, but its Chrome-Profile-25 dependency doesn't exist in this environment (no keyring/DBUS access) — needs manual cookie re-extraction from Tony's live session elsewhere. |
| 8 | GGS/Bailey (Slack + Matrix) | Customer (Joey) escalated multiple stock bugs "100% only happens since update" — Amy actively triaging, audit promised "tomorrow morning". Dev/bug discussion, does not block Trello per policy, but a real customer-visible issue worth watching. |
| 9 | Swish (vuongtrancr email) | Recurring "Signal lost for 10 minutes on Low Application Throughput" (8x) + "Metric query deviated from baseline" (4x) spread across the day — chronic APM pattern, no single confirmed outage. |
| 10 | Aysar (Baamboozle) | MPDM channel `C07SQ4HAUHZ` silent since before window start (continuing from prior days) — cannot confirm Carrick's daily "Today's update" was posted. Cross-check with KhanhHH hours also blocked (#4). |
| 11 | Upwork (Neural Contract) | Cloudflare challenge blocks the workroom check. Fixed a real script bug along the way (`upwork-neural-check.js` used an invalid Playwright-only `:has-text()` selector in Puppeteer, causing a hard crash pre-Cloudflare) — now fails cleanly at the Cloudflare wall instead. Per policy, silence/session-failure ≠ alert; Trello item still completed. |

**Today (Tue 21 Jul):** No leave-plan messages surfaced this window beyond 07-20's absences (LuHX, ThangN, KhoaTD, PhongTB, NamNN — all already processed and closed out per Matrix leave tracker). No new leave notes for today as of 07:45.

Full details: reports/2026-07-21/matrix-rooms-0618.md

### ⚠️ Action items for DuongDN (2)

| Room | Time | Message |
|------|------|---------|
| Project-info-gathering room | 10:11 | anhnvn: "À, với a Dương cho e thêm vài info về project nếu có nha: Partnership duration, bối cảnh khi team mình join..." — needs project background info for a client proposal/doc draft |
| Bailey - BA/QC | 11:05 | datnc: "Với tasklog của a Tuấn chung chung quá, e có bảo ảnh update lại tasklog cho rõ ra... e báo bên a Dương 1 tí" — FYI Tuan's tasklog flagged too vague, review-relevant |

### Key updates

**Fountain — W plan posted 11:37 by trinhmtt:**
- ViTHT 40h, ThinhT 20h, DatNT 40h => QC 25h (DatNT in for VuTQ's usual slot this week)
- DatNT fixed 2 Redmine bugs (#79835, #79886) on Infinity Beta; ViTHT fixed hover bug card #2895; VuTQ closed a logo-only draft PR for card #2990

- trinhmtt: new stock bugs reported, "100% only happens since update" — same incident as Joey's Slack complaints in #barcode-stock-and-picking-location
- Rail 6 staging test this week, Rail 7 in progress, new client tasks blocked pending client approval (unresponsive since last Monday)
- datnc flagged Tuan's tasklog too vague, asked for detail (relevant to Workstream review)

| /search/-1%2525...waitfor delay '0:0:15'--/page/288/ | 17,805 | 1 |

⚠️ **Security note:** 2 of the 5 slowest transactions are time-based blind SQL-injection probes against the `/search/` endpoint (`WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:15'` payload, response time ≈ delay = injection landed on a code path that executes the query, even if not exploitable). Same known WP_Error/JSON_API bugs persist unresolved (45x/34x, unchanged for multiple days). mysqli_real_connect no-socket errors (5x) suggest transient local DB connectivity hiccups.

⚠️ **Fountain ArgumentError/NoMethodError volume is UP, not tapering** — 95+90 today vs 9+9 reported 07-19. This is the SAME error signature flagged as an active production incident 07-18 (Rollbar #276-287); it reactivated/worsened rather than resolving. Matches rick@ email alerts (new errors #288/#289/#290 today, #284 hit 100 occurrences).

## Elena — 07:05 (+07:00)

- **Elena-SamGuard-Digital-Plant (duongdn):** 0 open PRs. Nothing to merge/deploy.
- **Precognize (nusken):** 0 open PRs by nusken (15 open total from other contributors). Note: `gh` CLI has no `nusken` account configured in this environment — used stored token from `config/.github-config.json` directly via curl instead.
- **WordPress samguard.co:** clean. 0 JS errors, 0 page errors, 0 CSP violations. `failedRequests` are all benign analytics/ads noise (Google Tag Manager, DoubleClick, GA4 collect calls) + one aborted `.mp4` load — no CSP directive violations among them.

Trello: Elena - SamGuard ✓ complete (pending Slack samguard cross-check — 0 activity, no alert).

## Sheets/Workstream — LongVV, PhucVT, TuanNT, KhanhHH, LeNH — 07:35 (+07:00)

**Data gap this run — documented, not glossed over:**
- Workstream SSO login attempted twice (`DISPLAY=:1 node scripts/workstream-login.js`), each run allowed to reach "Clicked Sign in with SSO" and then time out (90s, then 150s) without capturing a token — consistent with 2026-07-20's same failure. This needs interactive human 2FA/consent that isn't completable headless in this session.
- Fell back to Google Sheets per the documented fallback rule. Ran `sheets-tasklog-scan.js` for all 5 devs against all 13 sheets for 2026-07-20. Result: **every sheet's W-tab day-block for 2026-07-20 is a bare unfilled template** (`Task dự án` rows present but no owner/hours in any column) — verified directly against raw cell data for Maddy (W16) and Paturevision (W37), not just trusting the script. This is NOT a per-dev 0h finding — it's the underlying data source itself being empty for this date, consistent with the team having fully moved daily logging to Workstream (confirmed 2026-07-13, apparently now including Paturevision/Bailey too, which the skill doc still lists as Sheets-only — that exception may now be stale).
- **Result: cannot produce verified hour totals for LongVV/PhucVT/TuanNT/KhanhHH/LeNH today.** Not treating this as a 0h/shortfall alert for any of them — that would be a false alarm given real Matrix/Slack evidence of active work (below). No reminders sent (Piece 9) based on this gap.

**Best-available qualitative signal (Matrix + Slack, cross-referenced above):**
| Dev | Evidence of activity 07-20 |
|-----|------------------------------|
| LongVV | Active on Maddy (17:44 progress report), catching up a confirmed 1.5h shortfall from last week, did 10h OT on James Diamond this week (deciding to stop further OT) |
| PhucVT | Covering PhongTB's leave day, active in Arthur/Meta-Stamp Matrix room (P2-7 blocker follow-up) |
| TuanNT | Scrin.io confirms 8h31m logged (John Yi company); Matrix Bailey-BA/QC room shows active engagement; own tasklog flagged by datnc as "too vague," needs more detail |
| KhanhHH | Matrix confirms active: 1 new Aysar TODO, ongoing Franc backlog, Elena tasks now reassigned to Sâm (may run low soon). Baamboozle MPDM (Aysar gate channel) itself silent since before window — see Slack section |
| LeNH | No direct Matrix/Slack evidence this window; review room confirms LeNH's ongoing James Diamond work trusted enough that DuongDN/PhucVT just stopped actively reviewing it (quality has been consistently fine) |

**Maddy JIRA cross-check + Workstream needsReview check: skipped this run** (both require live Workstream access, same blocker as above).

Trello: Maddy, John Yi, Bailey, Rebecca, Aysar, Elliott ⚠️ left incomplete — genuine data-source outage (Workstream SSO + stale Sheets), not a confirmed shortfall. Will retry Workstream login on next run/recheck.

## Fountain (3-part check) — 07:40 (+07:00)

**Part 1 — Matrix Plan:** ✅ Posted by trinhmtt at 11:37 (`Kunal - Fountain` Matrix room): **ViTHT 40h, ThinhT 20h, DatNT 40h => QC 25h** (DatNT covering VuTQ's usual dev slot this week). Cited above in Matrix section.

**Part 2 — Task Log Actuals:** ⚠️ Unavailable this run. Workstream project `fountain` (id `cmpqcjojh00q2tk1v2qi7gs0j`) requires the same SSO login that failed twice (see Sheets/Workstream section above). Fallback Sheet (`1iIKfjAh...`, tab W36) verified directly — day-block for 07-20 is a bare unfilled template, same as all other sheets, confirming the project has moved fully to Workstream logging.

**Part 3 — Plan vs Actual:** ⚠️ Cannot compute without Part 2 actuals — deferred to next successful Workstream run.

**Trello Board (Fountain):**
- Customer comments (kunalsheth, tmmckay, mike62798179, iris63293413) in window: **0** — checked via `commentCard` actions since window start, none from the 4 tracked customer accounts.
- List counts: To-Do 26, Bugs 16, Doing 7, QC Internal Backlog 8, QA Backlog 1, In QA 0, Not Passed 0, Done 977, Seasonal 6, Notes 7, Shelf 11.
- **Stuck cards (5+ days, Doing/Bugs/QC lists):** long-standing backlog, oldest first: "Fountain Pro- not uploading to shipstation" (104d), "Giftdrop Links Not Sending" (98d), "Fountain - build a box/product catalog modal issue" (77d), "Infinity Order - 6358531LG" (74d), "NoMethodError in pro_cart_items#destroy" (74d), "Fountain pro pending bug" (60d), "Fountain Pro- order did not upload all recipients" (31d), plus 6 more in the 5-20 day range (auth token, mailgun, receipt download, PayPal, ShipStation, rose swatches, Next.js 16 upgrade, Bottle engraving, Smart Link, delivery-date bug).
- **Hard-to-release (Doing 14+ days):** "Infinity Blog" (19 days in Doing, no Done yet).

Trello: Fountain ⚠️ left incomplete — Parts 2-3 blocked by Workstream outage (real alert candidates: 2 items past 14-day hard-to-release threshold, error-volume spike noted in Performance section, but no NEW customer comment this window).

---

## OhCleo Slack — 07:15 (+07:00)

⚠️ **Unavailable this run — diagnosed, not just reported.** `auth.test` returns `invalid_auth` for the stored OhCleo xoxc token. Attempted fix: `node scripts/slack-extract-ohcleo-token.js` → fails because `scripts/get-slack-all-cookies.py` was deleted in the same bulk-cleanup commit (`d0d3fd5`, 2026-07-15) that deleted `facebook-page-scraper.js` (see memory `feedback_facebook_scraper_file_deleted`). **Restored the script from git history** (`git show 32093d4:scripts/get-slack-all-cookies.py`), but its underlying dependency — `/home/nus/.config/google-chrome/Profile 25/Cookies` (Tony's Chrome profile) — does not exist in this environment (this session runs as user `mpfc`, home dir has only `Profile 19`, no `Profile 25` anywhere). This is a genuine environment gap: OhCleo's only prior extraction path required a specific Chrome profile that isn't present here, not an auth/token problem.
- New Relic performance data for OhCleo IS available and included in the Performance section above.
- Manual fix needed: re-extract OhCleo's `d` cookie from Tony's live Chrome session on a host where Profile 25 exists, then update `config/.slack-accounts.json` → re-encrypt.

Trello: Ohcleo item ⚠️ left incomplete — genuine tooling/environment gap, not an alert.

## Philip — MS Teams — 07:50 (+07:00)

⚠️ Unavailable this run. `fetch-msteams-customer-messages.js will "Philip Briggs"` hit a Microsoft account security challenge ("Help us protect your account — we've detected some [unusual activity]") on the `will@nustechnology.com` login flow, looping for 150s without resolving — needs interactive verification (SMS/authenticator), same class of blocker as Workstream SSO. Not a script bug this time (script ran correctly, got stuck at a genuine MS security gate). Deferred to a session with interactive access.

Trello: Philip ⚠️ left incomplete — genuine auth/environment gap, not an alert.

## Reminders — 07:45 (+07:00)

No reminders identified/sent this run. Reason: the Sheets/Workstream data gap above means there is no verified 0h finding for any dev today — Matrix/Slack evidence shows LongVV, PhucVT, TuanNT, KhanhHH all had real activity 07-20, so a "0h logged" reminder message would very likely be false (same failure mode flagged in memory `feedback_tasklog_0h_reminder_complete`: never send a 0h reminder without a verified real number). Deferred to next successful Workstream/Sheets run.

## Re-check — 08:40 (+07:00)

**What changed: Workstream SSO, Arthur Slack, GitHub (davidztv), OhCleo Slack — all fixed.**

Fixed 4 auth/data gaps that blocked the morning cron:

- **Workstream SSO** ✅ — Login succeeded (token captured from headless browser)
- **Arthur Slack Solid Code** ✅ — Fresh `d` cookie extracted via `get-slack-all-cookies.py` (restored from git history), `auth.test` verified user=namtv
- **GitHub davidztv** ✅ — davidztv account already configured in `gh` CLI (`Christebob/Meta_Stamp_V3` accessible: 13 PRs, 0 commits since 15/7)
- **OhCleo Slack** ✅ — Chrome Profile 25 exists in this env after all (not missing), `d` cookie extracted, xoxc token was always valid — `auth.test` returns user=tony

**Still unfixable (environment/human gates):**
- **Philip/MS Teams** — Microsoft account security challenge ("unusual activity"), needs interactive SMS/authenticator
- **Fountain Part 2-3 actuals** — Workstream now has data, but only Mon 7/20 is available. Mon data: ThinhT 4h, PhatDLT 2.5h. Plan vs Actual: ViTHT 40h (0 logged Mon), ThinhT 20h (4/20 Mon), DatNT 40h (0 logged Mon) — early week, not alarming yet. PhatDLT QC needs review (2.5h, pending VuTQ/DuongDN).

**Workstream needsReview (new, from recheck):**

| Project | Employee | Task | Charged | Reviewer |
|---------|----------|------|---------|----------|
| RDC/Franc | KhanhHH | 7 items (Tidy plugins, fix update_plugins, phantom pin, .gitmodules, Adana deploy, locale keys, MPXCapture) | 8h | LeNH |
| Crystal lang (Arthur) | PhucVT | Check & discuss Metastamp V3 | 2h | TienND |

**Maddy JIRA cross-check:** ran — W16 has 0 LIFM2 ticket entries in task log (logging likely moved to Workstream entirely). No action needed.

**Cleared:** Maddy, Aysar, Elliott, Bailey, Rebecca, OhCleo, Blair Brown  
**Still open:** Fountain, Philip, Arthur
