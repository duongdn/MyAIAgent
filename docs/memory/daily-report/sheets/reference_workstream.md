🔴 **List grew 10→17+Others, found 2026-07-02** (previous growth: 5→10 on 2026-06-23). "Blair Brown WordPress" was renamed to "Peptide Clyde" in the UI — same project ID, not a new project. The 8 genuinely new projects (Amazing Meds, Elevate365.AI, Neural Contract, Radio Data Center, Speedventory, Tokenlite, LegalAtoms, BXR App) mean **John Yi, Philip, Neural, Franc, Bailey, Marcel, Raymond, and Rory Trello gates — previously treated as Slack-only — may now also need a Workstream cross-check**, the same way Maddy/Rebecca/Aysar/Generator/etc. already do. **This list is NOT exhaustive and will drift again — always live-query before trusting it.**

⚠️ **MANDATORY before flagging ANY dev shortfall/0h:** query `GET {api_base}/time/projects?date={date}` (using YOUR OWN token — returns only projects you're a member of, may also be incomplete) AND cross-check `/review/week?projectId={id}&date={date}` for every ID in the table above, filtering rows by `employeeName`. Do not rely on the static table alone — it has been wrong three times now (2026-05, 2026-06-23, 2026-07-02).

## Scripts

```bash
# Login (run once / when token expires)
DISPLAY=:1 node scripts/workstream-login.js

# Canonical shortfall check — scans ALL sheets + ALL live Workstream projects, no per-dev subset
node scripts/sheets-tasklog-scan.js <YYYY-MM-DD> <dev1> [dev2 ...]

# Fetch week data (single project)
node scripts/workstream-fetch-project-week.js [YYYY-MM-DD] [maddy|rebecca]
```

🔴 **Never write a new dated `daily-sheets-scan-YYMMDD-*.js` script.** That pattern caused the KhanhHH/Generator false-alert to recur on 2026-06-24, one day after first being diagnosed, because the fix applied to one day's copy didn't carry to the next. Old copies archived to `scripts/archive/`. See [[feedback_no_dated_scan_scripts]].

## Config

`config/.workstream-config.json` (encrypted, in decrypt-secrets.sh)
- `access_token` — Keycloak Bearer token (auto-refreshed by login script)
- `api_base` — `https://workstream.nustechnology.com/api`
- `projects` — project IDs for maddy/rebecca

## API

Base: `https://workstream.nustechnology.com/api` (this already includes `/api` — do NOT append another `/api/` prefix, it 404s)
- `{api_base}/review/week?projectId={id}&date={YYYY-MM-DD}` → all member task logs for week
- `{api_base}/time/projects?date={date}` → projects for current user
- `{api_base}/me` → current user info

**CORRECTED 2026-06-18:** `workstream-login.js` and `workstream-fetch-project-week.js` both had a double `/api/api/` bug — every call 404'd, so `ensureToken()` always thought the token was expired. Fixed to single-prefix path. If "login failed"/"token expired" shows up again, check for re-introduction of a double `/api/` prefix before assuming a real auth issue.

**2026-07-02 cron failure:** SSO login failed silently in the cron daily-report run (05:01), causing PhucVT and KhanhHH to be falsely reported "0h no leave" (Sheets-only view). Recheck re-ran `workstream-login.js` interactively, succeeded, and found PhucVT 8h (Portfolio-James Diamond) and KhanhHH 3.5h (Generator) — both real. Cron-mode Workstream login may need a retry/backoff since it can't always complete SSO non-interactively.

## Auth

Keycloak SSO: `https://auth.nustechnology.com/realms/main`
- Only `authorization_code` flow supported (no password/device grant for `workstream` client)
- Login opens browser on DISPLAY :1, SSO auto-completes (same realm as Matrix)
- Token valid for ~few hours, auto-refreshed on 401

## Integration

Use in daily/weekly/Monday reports alongside Google Sheets:
- `missingReportDays` → alert if weekday with no client report
- `weekTotal` → actual hours (compare with Sheets for consistency)
- `weekCharged` → billed hours (compare with Upwork)
