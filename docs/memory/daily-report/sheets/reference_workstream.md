# Workstream — workstream.nustechnology.com

Internal task-log system running parallel to Google Sheets for **Maddy** and **Rebecca** projects.

## Projects

Scan ALL of these for every dev's hours. Do NOT pre-assign which projects belong to which dev — any dev may log hours in any project.

| Key | Workstream name | Client | Project ID |
|-----|----------------|--------|-----------|
| maddy | Xtreme Soft Solutions | Maddy | `cmpqc1v7v00ahtk1vs1817xt8` |
| rebecca | MissSwimwear | Rebecca Pechey | `cmpqcflkx00litk1vic3vki6j` |
| baamboozle | Baamboozle / Aysar | Aysar Siddiqui | `cmqez93ka07q8p81v7035l3td` |
| colin-etz | ETZ - Wathaga | Colin CardWell | `cmqezatb807qvp81vpnzzimmp` |
| blair-brown | Blair Brown WordPress | Blair Brown | `cmqj4tj6v01gfm81vgx7ipkov` |
| james-portfolio | Portfolio - James Diamond | James Diamond | `cmqook9vf0kl8m81vusyo8ppt` |
| family-app | Family App | Charles Chang | `cmqezfyzv07z6p81vf403t9lp` |
| generator | Generator | Elliott Bouher | `cmqoou4h10kzum81vovi8rrsk` |
| fountain | Fountain Greetings | Kunal | `cmpqcjojh00q2tk1v2qi7gs0j` |
| others | Others | NUS | `cmpqae4pd0006qa1wo85fzvji` |

🔴 **List grew from 5→10 projects, found 2026-06-23.** KhanhHH was falsely flagged "2h shortfall" — actual was 8h, the missing 6h was all logged under **Generator** (Elliott's project), which wasn't in the static list above. Also found: Fountain devs (ViTHT/ThinhT/HungPN) log real hours to the **Fountain Greetings** WS project — the Google Sheet W{n} tab can show 0h while Workstream has the true data. **This list is NOT exhaustive and will drift again.**

⚠️ **MANDATORY before flagging ANY dev shortfall/0h:** query `GET {api_base}/time/projects?date={date}` (using YOUR OWN token — returns only projects you're a member of, may also be incomplete) AND cross-check `/review/week?projectId={id}&date={date}` for every ID in the table above, filtering rows by `employeeName`. Do not rely on the static table alone — it has been wrong twice now.

## Scripts

```bash
# Login (run once / when token expires)
DISPLAY=:1 node scripts/workstream-login.js

# Canonical shortfall check — scans ALL sheets + ALL live Workstream projects, no per-dev subset
node scripts/sheets-tasklog-scan.js <YYYY-MM-DD> <dev1> [dev2 ...]

# Fetch week data (single project)
node scripts/workstream-fetch-project-week.js [YYYY-MM-DD] [maddy|rebecca]
```

🔴 **Never write a new dated `daily-sheets-scan-YYMMDD-*.js` script.** That pattern caused the KhanhHH/Generator false-alert to recur on 2026-06-24, one day after first being diagnosed, because the fix applied to one day's copy didn't carry to the next. Old copies archived to `scripts/archive/`. See [[feedback_no_dated_scan_scripts]].

## Config

`config/.workstream-config.json` (encrypted, in decrypt-secrets.sh)
- `access_token` — Keycloak Bearer token (auto-refreshed by login script)
- `api_base` — `https://workstream.nustechnology.com/api`
- `projects` — project IDs for maddy/rebecca

## API

Base: `https://workstream.nustechnology.com/api` (this already includes `/api` — do NOT append another `/api/` prefix, it 404s)
- `{api_base}/review/week?projectId={id}&date={YYYY-MM-DD}` → all member task logs for week
- `{api_base}/time/projects?date={date}` → projects for current user
- `{api_base}/me` → current user info

**CORRECTED 2026-06-18:** `workstream-login.js` and `workstream-fetch-project-week.js` both had a double `/api/api/` bug (e.g. called `config.api_base + '/api/me'` when `api_base` already ends in `/api`) — every call 404'd, so `ensureToken()` always thought the token was expired and looped into re-login, which then ALSO verified with the same double-prefixed path and failed. This silently produced false "Workstream unavailable / login failed" in daily reports (e.g. LongVV "0h, Workstream login failed" on 2026-06-18 cron run was actually just this bug — the token was valid the whole time, confirmed by calling `{api_base}/me` directly → 200 OK). Fixed both scripts to use the single-prefix path. If "login failed" or "token expired" shows up for Workstream again, check for re-introduction of a double `/api/` prefix before assuming a real auth issue.

## Auth

Keycloak SSO: `https://auth.nustechnology.com/realms/main`
- Only `authorization_code` flow supported (no password/device grant for `workstream` client)
- Login opens browser on DISPLAY :1, SSO auto-completes (same realm as Matrix)
- Token valid for ~few hours, auto-refreshed on 401

## Integration

Use in daily/weekly/Monday reports alongside Google Sheets:
- `missingReportDays` → alert if weekday with no client report
- `weekTotal` → actual hours (compare with Sheets for consistency)
- `weekCharged` → billed hours (compare with Upwork)
